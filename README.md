## What is [Matrix]

> [Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/index) is an open network for secure, decentralized communication, which can be used similarly to [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im) on your phone.
>
> Pidgin tries to have all your friends in one place in Linux, regardless of what IM they use. With Matrix you can have your phone client connected to your private server which can all be highly customized. Matrix does not use the XMPP protocol, it uses a REST API so that it could be easier to extend.

The [Matrix] client [Element](https://element.io/) is a universal secure chat app entirely under your control. It supports desktop (Windows, Mac and Linux) and mobile (Android and iOS)

## What is `matrix-appservice-wechaty`

`matrix-appservice-wechaty` is a WeChat (微信) Matrix AppService for bridging your WeChat groups to Matrix rooms.

It has been officially listed at [[Matrix] Bridge Page for Wechaty](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/bridge/matrix-appservice-wechaty).

According to [Types of Bridging](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/types-of-bridging), the Matrix Wechaty Bot implements a [Simple Puppeted Bridge](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/types-of-bridging#simple-puppeted-bridge) with [Portal Rooms](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/types-of-bridging#portal-rooms) because we want to bring all conversations from WeChat to Matrix, and let the Matrix user control his account on Wechat.

## Features

1. Supports connecting to Wechat via the [Web](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-puppeteer)/[iPad](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-padplus)/[Hostie](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-hostie)/Windows/Mac WeChat protocols, with the power of [Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty)
1. Maps all Wechat users/room/official accounts to Matrix virtual users

## Requirements

1. A Matrix homeserver that supports application services (e.g. [Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse))
1. Node.js wit NPM, or Docker

## Installation

[![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/matrix-appservice-wechaty.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/matrix-appservice-wechaty)
[![npm (next)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/matrix-appservice-wechaty/next.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/matrix-appservice-wechaty?activeTab=versions)

```sh
sudo npm install -g matrix-appservice-wechaty
```

`matrix-appservcie-wechaty` is all you need.

### 1 Configure `config.yaml`

Copy [config/config.sample.yaml](https://github.com/chatie/matrix-appservice-wechaty/blob/master/config/config.sample.yaml) to `config.yaml` and update it to match your setup.

1. `domain` needs to change to your domain name, which should point to your homeserver.
1. `homeserverUrl` needs to change to your homeserver url, with the port number included.
1. `registration` needs to change to your registration yaml file name (see next part for how to generate it)

### 2 Generate `wechaty-registration.yaml`

After we setup the `config.yaml`, then we can generate the `wechaty-registration.yaml` file for registering the appservice to the homeserver:

```sh
export APP_SERVICE_ENDPOINT='http://localhost:8788'

matrix-appservice-wechaty \
  --config  config.yaml \
  --url     "$APP_SERVICE_ENDPOINT" \
  --generate-registration
```

Note: The URL `APP_SERVICE_ENDPIOINT` is used by the home server to communicate with the appservice, in this example is: `http://localhost:8788`. If you have other appservices, or other requirements, pick an appropriate hostname and port.

### 3 Register the App Service

Edit your `homeserver.yaml` file and update the `app_service_config_files` entry with the path to the `wechaty-registration.yaml` file.

```json
app_service_config_files: ["/data/wechaty-registration.yaml"]
```

### 4 Restart Home Server (Synapse)

You will then need to restart the synapse server.

For docker users:

```sh
export SYNAPSE_CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps | grep synapse | awk '{print $1}')
docker restart $SYNAPSE_CONTAINER_ID
```

Or if you are not using docker:

```sh
synctl restart
```

Remember to restart it every time the registration file is updated.

## Launch the Wechaty AppService Bridge

Let's start the `matrix-appservice-wechaty` bridge, with the port specified in `wechaty-registration.yaml` (`8788` in the above example)

```shell
export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-padplus
export WECHATY_PUPPET_PADPLUS_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

matrix-appservice-wechaty \
  --config  config.yaml \
  --file    wechaty-registration.yaml
```

> Note: [Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty) is a very powerful framework that supporting Web, iPad, Win32, Mac, iOS protocols of WeChat. Learn more about WeChaty protocols at our [Wechaty Puppet Directory](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet/wiki/Directory), and you can apply for a token for using [wechaty-puppet-padplus](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-padplus) at our [Support Developers Program](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/wiki/Support-Developers)

The bridge should start working shortly afterwards.

The current path (`$(pwd)`) should have the `wechaty-registration.yaml` file and `config.yaml` file. Additional bridge-related data will be stored here.

## Examples

### Example `wechaty-registration.yaml`

```yaml
id: wechaty
hs_token: 4f2763d5cc6e931967ec89efdde1123772945184b4cbe99e8fa9538122015e92
as_token: c27815bdd699d2eaefb499c83f99ce1a7983a9688811269fbcc17b632b0b250e
namespaces:
  users:
    - exclusive: true
      regex: '@wechaty_.*'
  aliases:
    - exclusive: true
      regex: '#wechaty_.*'
  rooms: []
url: matrix.chatie.io:8788
sender_localpart: wechaty
rate_limited: false
protocols:
  - wechaty
```

### Example `config.yaml`

```yaml
domain: chatie.io
homeserverUrl: https://matrix.chatie.io
registration: wechaty-registration.yaml
```

### Example Docker Compose File

[![dockeri.co](https://dockeri.co/image/wechaty/matrix-appservice)](https://hub.docker.com/r/wechaty/matrix-appservice)

We have published a docker image [wechaty/matrix-appservice](https://hub.docker.com/r/wechaty/matrix-appservice) for your convenience.

You can use docker to run matrix-appservice-wechaty bridge by adding the following configs to your `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
matrix-appservice-wechaty:
  container_name: matrix-appservice-wechaty
  image: wechaty/matrix-appservice
  volumes:
  - ./bridges/matrix-appservice-wechaty:/data
  networks:
  - default
  environment:
  - WECHATY_PUPPET_PADPLUS_TOKEN=puppet_padplus_<token>
  - WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-padplus
  command: ["--config", "/data/config.yaml", "--file", "/data/wechaty-registration.yaml", "--port", "8788"]
```

## Bridge Usage

1. Direct Message Wechaty Bot (`@wechaty:your.domain.ltd`)
1. Send the message `!login` (three times... wip... )
1. The `wechaty` app service bot will then send you a QR Code for scanning on WeChat.

After you have scanned the QR Code and confirmed it on your phone, everything will be setup automatically by the wechaty bot.

### Authentication

#### Logging in

1. Start a chat with the bridge bot. The bot should say _"This room has been registered as your bridge management/status room."_ if you started the chat correctly.
1. Run `!login`
1. Log in by scanning the QR code. If the code expires before you scan it, the bridge will send an error to notify you.
    1. Open Wechat on your phone.
    1. Tap Menu or Settings and select Scan.
    1. Point your phone at the image sent by the bot to capture the code.
1. Finally, the bot should inform you of a successful login and the bridge should start creating portal rooms for all your Wechat groups and private chats.

#### Logging out

Simply run the `!logout` management command.

## Background

- [Integrate Wechat with Matrix with the power of Wechaty #1737](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/issues/1737)

>
> This week I had a great talk with YC partner Eric @[ericmigi](https://github.com/ericmigi), who is a serial entrepreneur and also a geek with technology. He uses Matrix a lot and almost integrated all the instance messanger to his Matrix.
>
> But, the matrix does not support Wechat yet. So we'd like to introduce a matrix-wechat bridge to implement the Wechat protocol, and fill the gap between Matrix and Wechat.
>
> @[ericmigi](https://github.com/ericmigi) provide some links that will help us to kick off a starter, hope we could make a workable POC soon, and any contribution will be welcome.
